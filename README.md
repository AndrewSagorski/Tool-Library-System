# Tool-Library-System
A simple, console-based program that works as an online tool library where there is admin and user configurations. It implements binary search tree and other search algorithms. This was created as a university project.

To use, simply run the program once opened in Visual Studio. There are two user menus available:

  1. Staff menu
  2. User/Member menu

Staff login uses the following details:

Username: staff
Password: today123
  
From the staff menu many forms of admin functionality are available. Main things are adding and removing tools to and from the library system, and into their specific categories. As well is the creation of users/members.

Some pre-made users are also avaialble for exploring the user/member menu, their usernames and passwords can be found at the top of 'Program.cs'.

Thanks for checking out this simple project!
